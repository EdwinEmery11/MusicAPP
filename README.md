1.	Brief
This project objective was to create a CRUD application with different tools, methodologies and technologies.
To comply with the objectives, I used the following technologies:
•	Trello board - containing user stories and tasks that need to be completed to meet the MVPs of this project.
•	A relational database in MySQL containing 2 tables.
•	Functional ASP.NET code that allowed for CRUD operations to be performed in the view.
•	Test analysis.
•	Azure DevOps for Continuous Integration that deploys to an app service.
•	Version control using Git.
•	A comprehensive risk assessment.
These were considered the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for my project.

As show in the image above, I created user stories based on functions the user wanted to do while accessing the web application. A user story is the end goal of the project that's expressed thru the user’s perspective
I also created acceptance criteria to consider the necessary software implementations to meet these requirements.
The rest of the board is divided in to two parts to do and done, in this project you can see that the MVP requirements of the project have been completed
